# DoMore Web Development Project

DoMore is a donation website that aims to facilitate and streamline the donation process for various causes and organizations. This project is organized into four main parts, each utilizing different technologies to create a robust and interactive web application.

## Parts of the Project

1. **HTML and CSS Implementation:**
   In this initial part of the project, HTML and CSS are used to build the structure and style the web pages. Basic design and layout elements are implemented to provide a foundation for the website.

2. **JavaScript and Bootstrap for Interactivity:**
   To enhance user interaction and provide a more dynamic experience, JavaScript and Bootstrap are incorporated. JavaScript is used to add interactivity, and Bootstrap is utilized for responsive design and additional styling features.

3. **SQLAlchemy Database Integration:**
   In this part, SQLAlchemy, a powerful Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), is integrated to handle the database operations. It allows the application to store, retrieve, and manage data related to donations and users efficiently.

4. **Flask Application Hosting:**
   The final part involves hosting the web application using Flask, a Python web framework. Flask enables us to serve the web pages and provide a seamless experience to users by handling requests and responses.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DoMore
